* (2018 USENIX)Injected and Delivered: Fabricating Implicit Control over Actuation Systems by Spoofing Inertial Sensors
** Summary
   In this paper, the author utilize the resonance effect of MEMS inertial sensors to devise two different non-invasive spoofing attack toward embedded sensors. To conduct these attacks, the authors analyze the sampling process and find the way to control the digital signal output via changing the acoustic signal's amplitude, frequency and phase. To assess the performance of these attacks, the authors evaluate their attacks on 25 different devices and find 23 of them affected by the acoustic signal.
** Challenge
   Previous works have utilized the ultrasound signal to attack the MEMS sensors in UAVs, however, they have a couple of deficiencies which are the main challenge of this paper.
   1. The output of the inertial sensors are digital signals sampled from the analog signal generated by resonance and in real scenarios the sample rate of the ADC converters have some drift. The authors find that even little drift can affect the output of sensors significantly. So to control the output, the drift in sampling rate must be considered.
** Main Idea
*** Attack Model
    The oscillation induced by resonant sound wave has the same frequency with it and there is an digitization process before generating the final reading of the sensor. Because the acoustic signal belongs to out-of-band signal, its frequency is much higher than the sampling rate which leads to the alias effect. The digitization signal can be illustrated below:
    $$ V[i] = A \cdot sin(2\pi \varepsilon \frac{i}{F_{s}} + \phi_{0}) $$
    where $F = n \cdot F_s + \varepsilon (-0.5 \cdot F_s < \varepsilon < 0.5 \cdot F_s)$ is the frequency of digital signal after alias.
    From the formulation above we can find out that if the sampling rate $F_s$ increase with a small amount $\delta F_s$ , the change in the frequency of the digital signal is n times more than it. So even little offset in sampling rate can cause significant affect.
    we can also manipulate the amplitude and phase of the digital signal by change the amplitude and frequency of acoustic signal respectively as the picture show below.

*** Attack Methods.
    Based on the analysis on the digitization process, the authors propose two kinds of attacks named side-swing attack and switching attack respectively. Because the pattern of the oscillation is a sinusoid signal, the accumulative offset induced by it is 0. So the basic idea of these two attack is trying to keep the digital in one direction and decrease it in the opposite orientation.
    In side-swing attack, the authors modulate the analog signal with two amplitude. When the digital signal is in target direction, the higher amplitude is used and when in inverse direction the other is used. The picture below show this process.

*** Evaluation
    To evaluate the effect of the embedded inertial sensor spoofing attack, The author conduct experiments on 25 different sensors under close-loop and open-loop systems. The result of the experiment can be shown in the two tables below.

    [[../images/wk1_table2.png]]
    With these experiments, the author find that 17 of the 25 inertial sensors can be implicitly controlled by the resonant attack.
** Strength
   1. Consider the effect of the sampling process.
   2. Propose methods to control generated signal to be in one direction.
   3. Use the feedback of the target device to choose parameters.
** Weakness
   1. The resulting digital signal is always oscillating signal and the methods can't generate arbitrary waveform.
* (2019 Wireless Communication)Localization and navigation in autonomous driving: Threats and countermeasures
** Solved Problem
   The paper contains two major parts.
   - In the first part the authors make a comprehensive survey toward security vulnerabilities in today's state-of-art navigation and localization technologies.
   - In the second part, the authors devise a novel route spoofing attack by injecting malicious code to modify the parameter of the route planning function in navigation apps.
** Main Idea
   The authors first construct a taxonomy about differentattacks on localization and navigation system. The maincomponents in these two systems are GPS and HD map. So,the authors classify different attacks base on their targetcomponent. For each sort of attack, the authors also discuss the countermeasures toward it.

   After investigating current attack methods the authors conduct their own route spoofing attack and prove them to be effective to the most popular navigation applications.
   The basic idea in the attack is trying to change the parameters of the route planning functions(i.e. the staring, destination and waypoint positions). To achieve this goal, the author use the workflow below:
   [[../images/wk11_workflow.png]]
   A rough description is to first disassemble the code of the navigation and inject malicious code to communicate to a malicious server after finding out the logic of the code.  
The authors conduct experiments on three popular navigation apps and find all of them affected significantly by the attack above. The author also prove that all of the apps that has a route planning functions may be vulnerable to the attack too.
