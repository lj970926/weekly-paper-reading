# (2020 SP)I Know Where You Parked Last Summer: Automated Reverse Engineering and Privacy Analysis of Modern Cars

## 1 Summary
Recently, with the development of electronic technologies in modern cars, the perspective to seem a vehicle as a pure mechanical device is out-of-date. But these Electronic Control Units(ECUs) also collect diverse information from the vehicles and transmit them to the cloud. Because of the secret nature of the automotive industry, the format of its transmission protocol can't be found from the OEM or any other third-party organizations. In this paper, the author proposed a new tool, AutoCAN for privacy and security analysis that reveals what data cars collect by tapping into in-vehicle network. Furthermore, the algorithm proposed in independent to the specific physical and link layer protocols.

## 2 Challenge
Reverse-engineering in-vehicle network.
