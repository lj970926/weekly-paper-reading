# (2018 ICRA)Robust and Precise Vehicle Localization based on Multi-sensor Fusionin Diverse City Scenes
# 1 Summary
In this paper the author proposed a robust and precise global localization system based on multi-sensor fusion. Specifically, the author fused sensor output from IMU, LiDAR and GNSS. A Kalman-Filter based method is used to generate the final localization information. To improve the accuracy the author used both intensity and altitude information from LiDAR. The algorithm is proved to have centimeter-grade accuracy in complex urban environment such as high way and tunnel by deploying it on a fleet of autonomous vehicles. The paper is present by Baidu Apollo team.
