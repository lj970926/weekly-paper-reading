# (2020 CCS)Cyber-Physical Inconsistency Vulnerability Identification for Safety Checks in Robotic Vehicles
## 1 Summary
In this paper, the author identified a new type of vulnerability for robotic vehicles, the cyber-physical inconsistency. The author explained the reason why this vulnerability happens is that the inherent linear of the control problems widely used in robotic vehicles.  After analyzing the cause of this phenomenon, the author a novel method that uses simulation and objective functions two find the scenarios where this vulnerability happen.  
With the simulation result, the author also conducted real-world experiments and identified several real cp-inconsistency. 
## 2 Challenge
The main challenge this research faces is that how to judge the cp-inconsistency happens. To solve this problem, the other uses program analysis and system identification to construct two objective functions.  
Another challenge reside in what can we do to identify a specific event happens in the simulation environment. The author proposed a resolution by using a virtual RV that runs parallel with the real RV.
## 3 Main Idea
### 3.1 Overview

The picture above shows the overall process to identify cp-inconsistency. First, In the upper-left corner, a program analysis method is used to analyze the source code of the control program to find condition statements related to the processing function of a specific event such as the crash of a UAV. Second, with the
