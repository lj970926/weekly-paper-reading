# (2020RSS)OverlapNet: Loop Closing for LiDAR-based SLAM

## 1 Summary
In this paper, the author proposed a new approach to detect the loop closures for SLAM based 3D laser scans. Unlike previous methods that use handcraft features, the author proposed a deep neural network to find loop closures using several cues generated by the laser scan. To evaluate the performance of the network, the author trained and tested the model in the KITTI odometry dataset and found it surpasses state-of-art detection method. Furthermore, to evaluate the generalization of the network, the author using the model trained in KITTI dataset and tested it in the Ford campus dataset and showed it performs well when in unknown environments.

## 2 Challenge
Loop closure detection is a classic problem in robot mapping. There have been a large number of works towards image-based SLAM. However, LiDAR-based SLAM is a novel topic and it has some difficulties to use traditional methods. The main challenge in LiDAR SLAM is the the raw point data is sparse and expensive to compute with.

## 3 Main Idea


# (2016 IROS)Fast Range Image-Based Segmentation of Sparse 3D Laser Scans for Online Operation

## 1 Solved Problem
In this paper, the author proposed a 3D laser scans segmentation algorithm that divides the original points cloud in two different objects. By converting the 3D scans to 2D image, the algorithm can obtain real-time segmentation.

## 2 Main Idea
The basic problem needed to be solved in the object segmentation is if two neighboring points are originated from the same object. To solve this problem, the author propose a threshold-based method.

The top picture is the original point cloud and the picture in the bottom-right is its top-down-view. The bottom-left picture shows the basic idea of the algorithm. In this picture the angle between the further beam and the connection between two adjacent beams is denoted as $\beta$. Intuitively, the angle is large is the difference between the distance of A and B is small. So we can set a threshold $\theta$ that when the angle $\beta$ is larger than $\theta$ then we consider the two points come from different objects.  
The divide the full laser image to different objects the author used a BFS algorithm to find every connected components in the image. The algorithm has a complexity of $O(n)$.

## 3 Highlights Worth Learning

1. The idea to use the angle $\beta$ as the measurement of segmentation.
2. Use a 2D image rather than the original point clout to accelerate the computation.
