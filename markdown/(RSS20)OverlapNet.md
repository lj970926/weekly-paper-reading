# (2020RSS)OverlapNet: Loop Closing for LiDAR-based SLAM

## 1 Summary
In this paper, the author proposed a new approach to detect the loop closures for SLAM based 3D laser scans. Unlike previous methods that use handcraft features, the author proposed a deep neural network to find loop closures using several cues generated by the laser scan. To evaluate the performance,
