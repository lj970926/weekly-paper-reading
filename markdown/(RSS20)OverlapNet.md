# (2020RSS)OverlapNet: Loop Closing for LiDAR-based SLAM

## 1 Summary
In this paper, the author proposed a new approach to detect the loop closures for SLAM based 3D laser scans. Unlike previous methods that use handcraft features, the author proposed a deep neural network to find loop closures using several cues generated by the laser scan. To evaluate the performance of the network, the author trained and tested the model in the KITTI odometry dataset and found it surpasses state-of-art detection method. Furthermore, to evaluate the generalization of the network, the author using the model trained in KITTI dataset and tested it in the Ford campus dataset and showed it performs well when in unknown environments.
