# (2020 MobiCom)Deaf-Aid: Mobile IoT Communication Exploiting Stealthy Speaker-to-Gyroscope Channel

## 1 Summary
The explosive development of IoT devices puts forward a higher demand for the communication technology. Because of the different purpose, there are a lot of existing electromagnetic wave based protocols, such as WiFi and Bluetooth. However, devices using one protocol can't communicate with devices with another protocol, which compromise the connectivity of smart devices. In this paper, the authors focus on the covert channel communication and proposed a communication system based on the resonance of the gyroscope triggered by ultrasound.

## 2 Challenge
The are several works which attempt to build connection via covert channel such as physical vibration. However, such devices all need either expensive device or strict operate condition, such as physical touch. So, the main contribution in this paper is that it proposes a general communication system without the need to modify current devices.  
Furthermore, because the covert channels are not designed originally toward communication, how to build robust communication on these deficient channels is another obstacle.

## 3 Main Idea
### 3.1 Syetem design
