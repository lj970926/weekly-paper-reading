# [(2017 SP) Towards Evaluating the Robustnessof Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7958570)

## Summary
In this paper, the author demonstrated that the previously proposed methods abount ehancing the robustness neural networks are less effective by introducing three novel attack algorithms that are successful on both secured and unsecured nerworks with a probability of 100%.  
The paper only focused on the computer vision nerual network, but the method it proposed may be suitable for different AI problem too.  

## Challenge
To perform the attack, we need to find an adversiral example based on the origin example.
