# (2021 Ubicomp)3D Point Cloud Generation with Millimeter-Wave Radar

## 1 Summary
Autonomous driving car relies heavily on the ability to percept the environment. However, current technologies used in AVs widely, such as camera and LiDAR, are vulnerable to weather condition. The Rader sensor doesn't has such limitation, but it can only get 2D perception in previous study, In this paper, the author proposed MILLIPOINT, which uses synthetic aperture radar to to construct 3D point clouds.

## 2 Challenge
Despite the all-weather operations of Radar, there are several factors that constrain the application of Vehicle Radars.

# SAR Imaging of Moving Targets
